# ===================================================
# NODE.JS TODO APP - AWS ECS DEPLOYMENT WORKFLOW
# ===================================================
# This workflow demonstrates how to deploy a Node.js application
# to Amazon ECS using GitHub Actions with complete CI/CD automation
# ===================================================

name: Deploy to Amazon ECS

# ===================================================
# WORKFLOW TRIGGERS
# ===================================================
on:
  # LEARNING POINT: Trigger on push to master branch
  # This ensures deployment happens automatically when code is merged
  push:
    branches: [ master ]
  
  # LEARNING POINT: Manual workflow dispatch
  # This allows developers to trigger deployments manually from GitHub UI
  workflow_dispatch:
    inputs:
      environment:
        description: 'Environment to deploy to'
        required: true
        default: 'production'
        type: choice
        options:
          - staging
          - production

# ===================================================
# ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
# ===================================================
# LEARNING POINT: Environment variables for reusability
# These variables make the workflow configurable and reusable across different projects
env:
  AWS_REGION: us-east-1                   # AWS region where resources are deployed
  ECR_REPOSITORY: todo-app                # ECR repository name for storing Docker images
  ECS_SERVICE: todo-app-service           # ECS service name that manages running tasks
  ECS_CLUSTER: todo-app-cluster           # ECS cluster that hosts the service
  ECS_TASK_DEFINITION: task-definition.json # Task definition file path in repository
  CONTAINER_NAME: todo-app-container      # Container name defined in task definition

# ===================================================
# PERMISSIONS
# ===================================================
# LEARNING POINT: GitHub Actions permissions
# This section defines what permissions the automatically provided GITHUB_TOKEN has
# 'contents: read' allows the workflow to checkout and read repository files
permissions:
  contents: read

  # ===================================================
  # DEPLOY JOB
  # ===================================================
  deploy:
    name: Deploy to ECS
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    
    # LEARNING POINT: GitHub Environments
    # Environments provide deployment protection rules, secrets, and approval workflows
    # This ensures sensitive deployments require proper authorization
    environment: production
    
    steps:
      # LEARNING POINT: Checkout repository code
      # This is typically the first step - it downloads the repository content
      # to the GitHub Actions runner so we can access our files
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      # LEARNING POINT: AWS Authentication
      # This step configures AWS credentials for subsequent AWS CLI commands
      # Uses repository secrets to securely authenticate with AWS services
      - name: Configure AWS credentials
        uses: aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials@v1
        with:
          aws-access-key-id: ${{ secrets.AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID }}
          aws-secret-access-key: ${{ secrets.AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY }}
          aws-region: ${{ env.AWS_REGION }}

      # LEARNING POINT: ECR Authentication
      # Amazon ECR requires Docker to authenticate before pushing images
      # This action handles the complex ECR login process automatically
      - name: Login to Amazon ECR
        id: login-ecr
        uses: aws-actions/amazon-ecr-login@v1

      # LEARNING POINT: Docker Build and Push Process
      # This step demonstrates the complete container image lifecycle:
      # 1. Build the Docker image using the Dockerfile in the repository
      # 2. Tag it with the commit SHA for version tracking
      # 3. Push it to ECR for deployment
      - name: Build, tag, and push image to Amazon ECR
        id: build-image
        env:
          ECR_REGISTRY: ${{ steps.login-ecr.outputs.registry }}
          IMAGE_TAG: ${{ github.sha }}  # Using commit SHA ensures unique tags
        run: |

          echo "Building Docker image with tag: $IMAGE_TAG"
          docker build -t $ECR_REGISTRY/$ECR_REPOSITORY:$IMAGE_TAG .
          
          # Push the built image to Amazon ECR
          echo "Pushing image to ECR repository: $ECR_REPOSITORY"
          docker push $ECR_REGISTRY/$ECR_REPOSITORY:$IMAGE_TAG
          
          # LEARNING POINT: GitHub Actions Output Variables
          # This stores the complete image URI for use in subsequent steps
          # Other steps can reference this using: steps.build-image.outputs.image
          echo "image=$ECR_REGISTRY/$ECR_REPOSITORY:$IMAGE_TAG" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT
          
          echo "✅ Image successfully built and pushed to ECR"

      # LEARNING POINT: Task Definition Update Process
      # ECS task definitions are immutable - you can't modify them directly
      # This action creates a new task definition revision with the updated image URI
      # while keeping all other configuration the same
      - name: Fill in the new image ID in the Amazon ECS task definition
        id: task-def
        uses: aws-actions/amazon-ecs-render-task-definition@v1
        with:
          task-definition: ${{ env.ECS_TASK_DEFINITION }}
          container-name: ${{ env.CONTAINER_NAME }}
          image: ${{ steps.build-image.outputs.image }}

      # LEARNING POINT: ECS Service Deployment
      # This step updates the ECS service to use the new task definition
      # ECS will perform a rolling deployment, gradually replacing old tasks with new ones
      # wait-for-service-stability ensures the workflow waits until deployment completes
      - name: Deploy Amazon ECS task definition
        uses: aws-actions/amazon-ecs-deploy-task-definition@v1
        with:
          task-definition: ${{ steps.task-def.outputs.task-definition }}
          service: ${{ env.ECS_SERVICE }}
          cluster: ${{ env.ECS_CLUSTER }}
          wait-for-service-stability: true # Waits ~3 minutes for deployment to stabilize

      # LEARNING POINT: Post-Deployment Verification
      # Always verify that your deployment was successful
      # This step checks the deployment status using AWS CLI
      - name: Verify deployment
        run: |
          echo "🔍 Verifying deployment status..."
          DEPLOYMENT_STATUS=$(aws ecs describe-services \
            --cluster ${{ env.ECS_CLUSTER }} \

          else
            echo "❌ Deployment may have issues. Check ECS console for details."
          fi

      # LEARNING POINT: Application URL Discovery
      # In ECS Fargate, tasks get dynamic public IPs
      # This step demonstrates how to programmatically find your application's URL
      - name: Get application URL
        run: |
          echo "🔍 Finding application URL..."
          echo "Waiting for task to fully start..."
          sleep 30  # Give the task time to start and register
          
          # Get the ARN of the running task
          TASK_ARN=$(aws ecs list-tasks \
            --cluster ${{ env.ECS_CLUSTER }} \
            --service ${{ env.ECS_SERVICE }} \
            --query 'taskArns[0]' \
            --output text)
          
          echo "📋 Task ARN: $TASK_ARN"

          NETWORK_INTERFACE=$(aws ecs describe-tasks \
            --cluster ${{ env.ECS_CLUSTER }} \
            --tasks $TASK_ARN \
            --query 'tasks[0].attachments[0].details[?name==`networkInterfaceId`].value' \
            --output text)
          
          echo "🌐 Network Interface: $NETWORK_INTERFACE"
          
          # Get the public IP address from the network interface
          PUBLIC_IP=$(aws ec2 describe-network-interfaces \
            --network-interface-ids $NETWORK_INTERFACE \
            --query 'NetworkInterfaces[0].Association.PublicIp' \
            --output text)
          
          echo "🌍 Public IP: $PUBLIC_IP"
          echo ""
          echo "🚀 Your application is available at: http://$PUBLIC_IP:8000"
          echo "📝 Save this URL to access your deployed application!"
